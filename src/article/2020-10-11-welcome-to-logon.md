## Welcome to LOGON - the online magazine of the Golden Rosycross.

Do you find yourself asking fundamental questions about life?

Are you seized by a dawning realization that there must be something beyond a career, beyond ‘likes’ and ‘dislikes’, daily chores and hardships?

LOGON might be for you.

Like a view from a mountaintop, LOGON explores a new perspective of the development of the human being and the changes in the societies of the 21st century emerging in art, science and religion.

LOGON is for people pondering their view of life.

We publish articles from many authorsfrom many countries, world regions and background who have been touched by these questions. Their contributions are inspired by their search for the meaning of life.

**Who is the human being?\
Can life ever die?\
What is the immortal aspect of humanity?**

Questions like these have a universal dimension. There are no quick answers based on a fixed viewpoint. Such questions are like doors leading to the innermost core of our being. And there are many doors leading to this core from many different directions. Experience urges us to change our actions and ultimately shape the course of our lives and our beliefs.

We hope that LOGON can add something to your life, inspire you to ask new questions and fuel your search for answers.
